I'm a computer science researcher in voting theory. Here is a list of my coding projects.

#### Method of Equal Shares

#### pref.tools

* [`abcvoting-app`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/abcvoting-app) - Web app for testing approval-based committee voting rules, using the [`abcvoting`](https://github.com/martinlackner/abcvoting) package.
* [`pabutools-app`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/pabutools-app) - Web app for testing approval-based participatory budgeting rules, using the [`pabutools`](https://github.com/pbvoting/pabutools) package.
* [`pref_voting-app`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/abcvoting-app) - Web app for testing ranking-based single-winner voting rules, using the [`pref_voting`](https://github.com/voting-tools/pref_voting) package.

#### tikz.dev

* [`pgf-tikz-html-manual`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/pgf-tikz-html-manual) - HTML version of the [`PGF/TikZ`](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf) manual, produced using [`lwarp`](https://github.com/bdtc/lwarp).
* [`pgfplots-html-manual`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/pgfplots-html-manual) - HTML version of the [`pgfplots`](https://pgfplots.sourceforge.net/) manual.
* [`tikz.dev-style`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/tikz.dev-style) - Repository with a minimal example of making websites in the style of [tikz.dev](https://tikz.dev).

#### Supreme Court of the United States

I've developed a hobby of following what happens at the Supreme Court, and am making tools to make the Court more accessible.

* [`scotusstats`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/scotusstats) - A [website](https://scotusstats.com/) presenting statistics about the Court in a customizable interface.
* [`scotus-podcast`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/scotus-podcast) - Code producing a [podcast feed](https://scotusstats.com/podcast/) of oral arguments, with podcast chapters and detailed description.
* [`scotus-videos`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/scotus-videos) - Code producing videos showing transcripts of oral arguments, published on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@SCOTUSOralArgument).

#### Linear Programming

* [`lp-model`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/lp-model) - A javascript library for modelling and solving (integer) linear programs.
* [`lpdual.com`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/lpdual.com) - Code for a simple website helping with constructing LP duals, versions of Farkas' lemma, and KKT conditions.

#### MP3 Chapters

* [`mp3chapters.github.io`](https://github.com/mp3chapters/mp3chapters.github.io) - A web app for adding chapters to mp3 files such as podcasts.
* [`mp3chapters-player`](https://github.com/mp3chapters/mp3chapters-player) - A desktop app for playing mp3 files that shows chapters.

#### Miscellaneous

* [`pqtree.js`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/pqtree.js) - Javascript code for making PQ-trees for the consecutive ones problem.
* [`drag-drop-weak-orders`](https://github.com/DominikPeters/drag-drop-weak-orders) - code for a simple drag and drop interface for weak orders (rankings with indifferences)
